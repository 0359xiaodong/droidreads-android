Params that have to configured:

In **app/build.gradle** file set:

 * GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY

	not used IIRC
	
 * GOODREADS_API_KEY, GOODREADS_API_SECRET

	get GoodReads API secrets here https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys
	
As it's often raised on GoodReads developer forum, to access their API one has to use OAuth.
If you are curious how it works on Android, go to package  https://github.com/pelotasplus/droidreads-android/tree/master/app/src/main/java/pl/pelotasplus/droidreads/api/oauth and see yourself how to use OAuth with Retrofit.
